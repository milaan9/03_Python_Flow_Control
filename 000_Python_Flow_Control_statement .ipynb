    "\n",
    "In Python programming, decision-making statements are those that **help in deciding the flow of the program**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, at times, you might want to execute a block of code only if a particular condition is satisfied. Well, in this case, decision-making statement will be of great help. Let us consider an example to understand this better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to note about Python's control flow statements and program structure is that it uses **`_indentation_`** to mark blocks. Hence the amount of white space (space or tab characters) at the start of a line is very important. This generally helps to make code more readable but can catch out new users of python."

But when this has to be coded, you will need the help of decision-making statements. To understand this, let's now look at how they function."
